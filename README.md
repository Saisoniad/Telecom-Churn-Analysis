# Telecom-Churn-Prediction-Project

## Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting customer churn in the prepaid telecom sector in India and Southeast Asia. The goal is to analyze customer-level data to identify high-risk churners, particularly high-value customers, and understand the factors influencing churn. This project serves as a capstone assignment for the Executive Post Graduate Program in Business Analytics at LIBA.

## Project Objectives

The primary objectives of the project are as follows:

1. **Churn Prediction:**  
   - Define churn using a usage-based definition.  
   - Develop a predictive model to classify customers as churners or non-churners.  

2. **Feature Engineering and Analysis:**  
   - Identify key indicators of customer churn.  
   - Address class imbalance in the dataset.  

3. **Insights and Recommendations:**  
   - Provide actionable insights to reduce churn.  
   - Suggest strategies to retain high-value customers.  

## Datasets Used

The project dataset contains customer-level information with the following attributes:  
- **Customer Demographics:** Basic information about customers.  
- **Usage Patterns:** Call, SMS, and data usage over time.  
- **Recharge and Revenue Data:** Details of recharge frequency and revenue generation.  

## Key Features

- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:**  
   - Handled missing values and outliers.  
   - Transformed raw data into meaningful features.  

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
   - Analyzed usage patterns and customer segments.  
   - Explored correlations between features and churn.  

- **Model Building:**  
   - Utilized machine learning algorithms to predict churn.  
   - Implemented techniques to handle class imbalance, such as oversampling and undersampling.  

- **Evaluation and Optimization:**  
   - Evaluated model performance using metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score.  
   - Optimized the model for better accuracy and interpretability.  

## Tools and Technologies

- **Python**: For data preprocessing, analysis, and model development (libraries include Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib).  
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For coding and presenting results.  

## Repository Contents

- **telecom_churn_prediction.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook containing the complete analysis, model-building, and insights.  
- **data/**: Folder containing the dataset used for the project.  
- **README.md**: Project overview and instructions.  

## Insights & Findings

Key insights from the project include:  
- High-value customers with irregular recharge patterns are more likely to churn.  
- Certain usage metrics, such as declining data usage, serve as early indicators of churn.  
- Personalized retention strategies for high-value customers can significantly improve retention rates.  

## Conclusion

This project highlights the importance of data-driven strategies in retaining customers and improving business performance. The insights and predictions generated can help telecom operators reduce churn and enhance customer satisfaction.
